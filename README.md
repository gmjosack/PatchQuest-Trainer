# PatchQuest-Trainer
Mod for Patch Quest that provides various ways to tune the game

## Installation

To install the Mod you'll need to first install [Melon Loader](https://github.com/LavaGang/MelonLoader/releases/latest).

Then copy the `PatchQuestTrainer.dll` from the [Latest Releases](https://github.com/gmjosack/PatchQuest-Trainer/releases/latest) into the `Mods` directory where `Patch Quest` is installed.

## Usage

With the mod installed you'll have a window where you can toggle various settings. You can hide the window with the `Insert` key. Any key binds will be noted next to the settings, for example `Invulnerability (i)` means it can be toggled with the `i` key.
